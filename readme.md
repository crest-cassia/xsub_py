# xsub-py

Another implementation of [xsub](https://github.com/crest-cassia/xsub) in Python.
XSUB is a wrapper for job schedulers. Job schedulers used in HPCs, such as Torque.
Since, those job schedulers often have its own I/O format and the users have to change their scripts to conform with its dialect.
XSUB is a wrapper script to absorb the difference.
This script is intended to be used by [OACIS](https://github.com/crest-cassia/oacis).

Although only a few types of schedulers are currently supported, you can extend xsub easily to support other schedulers.
We are also happy to receive your pull requests on your extensions to support more schedulers.

## Installation

- Python 3.6 or later is required.
- Clone this repository

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/crest-cassia/xsub_py.git
  ```

- set `PATH` and `XSUB_TYPE` environment variables in your `~/.bash_profile`
  - set `PATH` so as to include the `bin` directory of this repository. Then you can use `xsub`, `xstat`, and `xdel` commands.
  - set `XSUB_TYPE` to be one of the supported schedulers listed below.
  - If you run xsub from OACIS, please set these variables in `.bash_profile` even if your login shell is zsh. This is because OACIS executes `xsub` on bash launched as a login shell.
    - do **NOT** set these environment variables in `.bashrc` because it is loaded only in an interactive shell, not in a login shell.

  ```sh:.bash_profile
  export PATH="$HOME/xsub_py/bin:$PATH"
  export XSUB_TYPE="none"
  ```

### Supported Schedulers

List of available schedulers.

- **none**
  - If you are not using a scheduler, please use this. The command is executed as a usual process.
- **torque**
  - [Torque](http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/open-source/torque/)
  - `qsub`, `qstat`, `qdel` commands are used.
- **slurm**
  - [SLURM](https://slurm.schedmd.com/)
  - `sbatch`, `squeue`, `scancel` commands are used.
- **fugaku**
  - Fugaku
  - `pjsub`, `pjstat`, `pjdel` commands are used.
- **pbs_pro**
  - [PBS Pro](https://altair.com/pbs-professional/)
  - `qsub`, `qstat`, `qdel` commands are used.

## Specification

The specification is identical to that of [the ruby version of xsub](https://github.com/crest-cassia/xsub#specification).

## Extending

- Fork the repository.
- Add another module in `bin/schedulers` directory. Let's say `your_scheduler.py` is your new module.
  - In your new module, define a new class, say `YourScheduler`, that contains the following constants and static methods.
    - constants: `TEMPLATE`
    - static methods:
      - `validate_parameters(params: dict) -> None`
      - `parent_script(parametes: dict, job_file: pathlib.Path, work_dir: pathlib.Path) -> str`
      - `submit_job(script_path: pathlib.Path, work_dir: pathlib.Path, log_dir: pathlib.Path, log: io.TextIOBase, parameters: dict) -> tuple[str,str]`
      - `all_status() -> str`
      - `multiple_status(job_ids: list[str]) -> dict[str,tuple[str,str]]`
      - `delete(job_id: str) -> str`
  - Examples can be found at [schedulers](https://github.com/yohm/xsub_py/tree/main/bin/schedulers) directory.
- Edit `bin/schedulers/__init__.py`
  - Add your scheduler class to `SCHEDULER_TYPES` like the following.
    ```diff
    SCHEDULER_TYPES = {
    -  "none": none.NoneScheduler
    +  "none": none.NoneScheduler,
    +  "your_scheduler": your_scheduler.YourScheduler
    }
    ```
- After you implemented your scheduler class, implement the unit test following the instructions [here](test/readme.md).
- set `XSUB_TYPE` environment variable to your new module name.
  - add `XSUB_TYPE=your_scheduler` to your `.bash_profile`. (case-insensitive)
- We would appreciate it if you send us your enhancement as a pull request:grin:
